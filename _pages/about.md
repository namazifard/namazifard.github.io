About me
======
Hi! I am an AI MS.c. student at the <b>[University of Tehran](https://www.ut.ac.ir/en)</b> under the advisorship of [Prof. Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh](https://yyaghoobzadeh.github.io/). My academic journey has been centered around exploring the vast landscape of NLP, with a particular focus on leveraging <b>Large Language Models</b> (LLMs) to address various challenges and opportunities in this field.

<!-- Previously, I recieved my master's degree at the <b>University of Tehran</b> advised by [Prof. Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh]
<!-- (https://yyaghoobzadeh.github.io/){:target="_blank"} on natural language processing (NLP).

<!-- and [Prof. Mohammad Taher Pilehvar](https://pilehvar.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.
