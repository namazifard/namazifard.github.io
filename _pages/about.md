About me
======
Hi! I am an AI MS.c. student at the <b>[University of Tehran](https://www.ut.ac.ir/en)</b> under the advisorship of [Prof. Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh](https://yyaghoobzadeh.github.io/). My academic journey has been centered around exploring the vast landscape of NLP, with a particular focus on leveraging <b>Large Language Models</b> (LLMs) to address various challenges and opportunities in this field.

<!-- Previously, I recieved my master's degree at the <b>University of Tehran</b> advised by [Prof. Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh]
<!-- (https://yyaghoobzadeh.github.io/){:target="_blank"} on natural language processing (NLP).

<!-- and [Prof. Mohammad Taher Pilehvar](https://pilehvar.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.
<!-- Hi! I am a master's student at the <b>University of Tehran</b>, and I have the pleasure of working with [Mohammad Taher Pilehvar](https://pilehvar.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, [Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh](https://yyaghoobzadeh.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, and [Azadeh Shakery](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~shakery){:target="_blank"} on natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. -->

Feel free to [email](mailto:namazifard.ut.ac.ir) me if you have any questions about my work or research/academia/programming-related topics!

Research Interests
======

My research interests span across several areas within NLP, including:

Multilingual Foundational Models: I’m intrigued by the potential of large language models to bridge language barriers and enhance communication across diverse linguistic contexts.

Multi-Agent Systems: Exploring the dynamics of interaction and collaboration among autonomous agents is a fascinating avenue for understanding complex systems and achieving collective intelligence.

Knowledge-Enhanced NLP: Integrating external knowledge sources into natural language understanding systems to improve performance and promote deeper comprehension.

Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning: Investigating techniques to transfer knowledge and insights gained from one language to another, particularly in low-resource language settings.

Responsible AI: Advocating for ethical considerations and fairness in the development and deployment of AI technologies, ensuring they serve societal interests and uphold fundamental values.
