About me
======
Hi! I am an AI MS.c. student at the <b>[University of Tehran](https://www.ut.ac.ir/en)</b> advised by [Prof. Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh](https://vnpeng.net/). Previously, I recieved my master's degree at the <b>University of Tehran</b> advised by [Prof. Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh](https://yyaghoobzadeh.github.io/){:target="_blank"} on natural language processing (NLP).

<!-- and [Prof. Mohammad Taher Pilehvar](https://pilehvar.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.
<!-- Hi! I am a master's student at the <b>University of Tehran</b>, and I have the pleasure of working with [Mohammad Taher Pilehvar](https://pilehvar.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, [Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh](https://yyaghoobzadeh.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, and [Azadeh Shakery](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~shakery){:target="_blank"} on natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. -->

My primary research interest lies in the area of <b>Natural Language Processing</b> (NLP), where I have done research on quantifying token attribution in Transformers [(ACL2023, ](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.149/)[NAACL2022)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.19), Metaphors in pre-trained language models [(ACL2022)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.144/), layer-wise probing BERToids [(BlackboxNLP@EMNLP2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.blackboxnlp-1.29), and finding important examples by gradient-based dataset pruning [(ENLSP@NeurIPS2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05610).
<!-- My B.Sc. final project was about assessing toxic detection knowledge of foundation models where I showed their interesting ability gained in pre-training as well as possible biases towards specific persons or groups. -->
